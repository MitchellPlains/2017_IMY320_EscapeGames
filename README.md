Website for our game

There is a bug with our functionality

To enable mouse wheel horizontal scroll:
Line 20 of Css needs to be enabled (position: fixed)
Remove the attributes from the body tag in index.html
  
To enable NAV links and animation scroll
Line 20 of CSS needs to be disabled (remove it)
  
If you end up seeing a blue screen with navbar:
Scroll up to reach the top
Happens if you switch between functionality
